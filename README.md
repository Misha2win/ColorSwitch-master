Color Switch is a game all about colors and platforming to solve puzzles and complete levels. 
The goal is to become green and get to the goal point (the green cirlce) to advance to the next level.

Controls:<br>
WASD to move<br>
E to use the item in your inventory<br>
R to restart the current level<br>
ESC to pause the game<br>
Backspace to go to the previous level<br>
B to enable debug mode (Changes how things render and allows you to go to all levels in the level select menu)<br>

In the builds folder you will find version folders that contain a folder and two executable jar files.
The other jar file will launch the game so that you can play it.
The jar file with the word editor in it will open the editor that will allow you to edit and save levels (the .level files found in the resources folder) in the game.
The resources folder contains everything regarding the level information:
  levelOrder.levels stores the order of the levels that appear when playing the game.
  .level files that are used to construct the levels when you open the game.
  .png files that are used to show previews of the levels in the level selection menu.
In the resources folder there is also a folder for old levels which is currently unused in all builds of the game but is there for archiving purposes.
